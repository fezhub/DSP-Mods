Dyson Sphere Program Mods by fezeral

**Do not report problems to the developers** when running any of these mods (or even a savegame you've used one of these mods in). The game currently does not support mods. The devs do not need spurious bug reports caused by a modded game. Reproduce your bug on a 100% vanilla game and save, or assume it's potentially related to a mod unless you know with 100% certainty it wasn't influenced in any way by any mod you have installed now or in the past. 

### Copy Inserters
When copying a building, the attached inserters are also copied to the new location

#### Known Issues
*As DSP's inserter posing logic is very complicated and can't be reproduced in full in a mod, some visual glitches may occur*

- Inserters on copied buildings a long distance from the source building may be visually mis-aligned
- Inserters on buildings will rotate incorrectly if the pasted building is rotated, smelters especially
