Dyson Sphere Program Mods by thisisbrad

**Do not report problems to the developers** when running any of these mods (or even a savegame you've used one of these mods in). The game currently does not support mods. The devs do not need spurious bug reports caused by a modded game. Reproduce your bug on a 100% vanilla game and save, or assume it's potentially related to a mod unless you know with 100% certainty it wasn't influenced in any way by any mod you have installed now or in the past. 

## Copy Inserters
When copying a building, the attached inserters are also copied to the new location
